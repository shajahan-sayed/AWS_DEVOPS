Route 53 — Deep Explanation for Mastery

Amazon Route 53 is a highly available, scalable, global DNS and domain management service.
Think of it as the “phonebook of the internet” + “routing intelligence” + “health checks” + “domain registrar”.

⭐ 1. What Route 53 Actually Does (The 3 Pillars)
✔ 1. Domain Registration

You can buy/manage domains like:

example.com
myapp.net
mycoolapp.org

✔ 2. DNS Hosting (Hosted Zones + Records)

DNS translates names → IPs.

Example:
app.example.com → 54.123.10.23 (EC2 public IP)

Route 53 stores DNS records inside Hosted Zones.

Types of records:

A Record – hostname → IPv4

AAAA – hostname → IPv6

CNAME – hostname → another hostname

MX – mail servers

TXT – verification, SPF, DKIM

NS – nameserver info

Alias – AWS special record (only in Route 53)

✔ 3. Intelligent Traffic Routing

Route 53 can route users based on:

Latency

Geo-location

Health checks

Weighted distribution

Failover

This goes beyond normal DNS.

⭐ 2. Understanding the Architecture of Route 53
### 🔹 HOSTED ZONE

A hosted zone is created for each domain.

Example:
example.com → Hosted Zone → Contains DNS records.

Two types:

Public Hosted Zone

Used for apps accessible on the internet.

Private Hosted Zone

Used inside VPC (internal DNS).

⭐ 3. Core DNS Record Types (You MUST Know These)
1. A-Record (Address Record)

Maps:

myapp.com → 54.10.20.30


Used for:

EC2 Public IP

CloudFront edge IP (via ALIAS)

ALB DNS (via ALIAS)

2. CNAME (Canonical Name)

Maps domain → another domain:

api.myapp.com → myapp-alb-123.aws.com


❗ You cannot create a CNAME for the root domain (example.com).

3. Alias Record (AWS only)

Alias = CNAME but:

works for root domain

free queries

faster resolution

recommended for AWS services

Alias works with:

ALB

CloudFront

API Gateway

S3 static website

Elastic Beanstalk

VPC endpoints

Example:

example.com → ALIAS → alb-123.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

4. MX, TXT, NS, SOA

Useful for:

email (MX)

domain verification (TXT)

nameserver details (NS)

⭐ 4. How DNS Resolution Actually Works (Step-by-Step)

When you type app.example.com:

Browser checks local DNS cache

Browser asks Recursive Resolver (ISP/Google 8.8.8.8)

Resolver checks Root → TLD (.com) → Route 53 Nameserver

Route 53 returns the A-record or CNAME

Browser connects to returned IP or host

This entire process usually takes milliseconds.

⭐ 5. TTL (Time to Live)

TTL determines how long DNS results are cached.

Short TTL (30 sec–1 min) → good for dynamic apps or migrating servers

Long TTL (1 hr) → good for stable services

TTL matters when you:

switch EC2 instance

switch ALB

do dev → prod migrations

⭐ 6. Health Checks (BIG INTERVIEW TOPIC)

Route 53 can monitor:

HTTP / HTTPS endpoint

CloudWatch metrics

Latency

TCP port health

If endpoint fails → Route 53 stops sending traffic there.

Used for:

Active-passive failover

Multi-region disaster recovery

Weighted routing with health dependency

⭐ 7. Routing Policies (Most Asked Topic)
1️⃣ Simple Routing (default)

One record → one IP.

2️⃣ Weighted Routing

Send percentage of traffic to different servers.

Useful for:

A/B testing

Slow migrations

Blue/Green deployments

3️⃣ Latency Routing

User connects to nearest region.

4️⃣ Failover Routing

Primary fails → send traffic to secondary.

5️⃣ Geolocation Routing

Traffic based on country/continent.

6️⃣ Multi-Value Answer

Returns multiple healthy records.

⭐ 8. Your Project: “Point Domain to EC2 / ALB”

Let’s rewrite your steps the correct AWS way.

🧪 Project 1: Point Domain → EC2
Steps

Buy domain in Route 53

Go to Hosted Zone → create record

Create A-Record

Name: app
Type: A
Value: 54.23.100.5 (EC2 public IP)
TTL: 60 sec


Now:
app.example.com → EC2 machine.

🧪 Project 2: Point Domain → ALB
Steps

ALB has a DNS name like:

myapp-alb-112233.aws.com


Create A-record (Alias)

Name: www
Type: A
Alias: Yes
Alias Target: myapp-alb-112233.aws.com


Now:
www.example.com → ALB → your EC2 instances.

⭐ 9. MASTER LEVEL TIPS
✔ If mapping to ALB → always use Alias A-record

Never use CNAME on root.

✔ If using CloudFront → always use Alias
✔ Use health checks in failover routing for DR
✔ Use short TTL during migrations
✔ Create separate subdomains for environments:
dev.example.com
staging.example.com
prod.example.com

✔ Use private hosted zones for internal microservices
